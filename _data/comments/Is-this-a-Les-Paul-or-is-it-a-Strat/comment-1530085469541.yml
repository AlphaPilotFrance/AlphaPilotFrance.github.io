message: "Hi Shiram\r\n\r\nWith this setup everything lives on the remote machine. The local machine only shows the notebook. So currently I simply scp my files onto the remote... But I also have a neat little script to get new images from Google, Baidu and Bing, clean them up and rename them... This script could also run on the server. I will write a short bit about that in the next days... Just a bit busy this week... I also haven't put the code on github yet. Will be also up next week (hopefully)"
