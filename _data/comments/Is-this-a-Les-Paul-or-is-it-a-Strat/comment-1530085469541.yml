message: "Hi Shiram\r\n\r\nWith this setup everything lives on the remote machine - the local machine only shows the notebook. So currently I simply *scp* my files onto the remote... But I also have a neat little script to get new images from Google, Baidu and Bing, clean them up and rename them (quite a bit better than the code in this post and return many more images). The scripts can run on the server, however you probably want to clean them up. I also wrote a super simple tool for that... I will write a short article about that in the next days... Just a bit busy this week (I also haven't put the code on github yet, sorry for that)."
