### Phase 1: Literature Review                                                        
Reviewing similar literature to select the most adequate indicator of success.

### Phase 2: Conceptualisation   
Researching the current means of learning so to select the most adapted concept for an online space.

The pilot project consisted of trialling three learning strategies to decide on a final concept.
I used Google Drive as a central repository, and I connected it to the local LMS, Vula.

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="First I allowed students to comment on the tutorials remotely (Google Drive)." %}

{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="Then I allowed students to comment on a test and memo just after the test (using Google Drive) ." %}

{% include gallery id="gallery4" caption="Finally students were given the opportunity to upload their own work for tutors to comment (using Google Drive) ." %}

This process suggested that students are most involved when they are given the opportunity to show their work to the tutors.

### Phase 3: Development   
Developing this concept into an online space that can be implemented in the course.

### Phase 4: Implementation   
Promoting the online space among students as a tool for learning.

### Phase 5: Iterations   
Iteratively developing the online space according to recommendations and maintenance issues.
