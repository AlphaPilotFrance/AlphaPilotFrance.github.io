<h2>Oh, hello!</h2>
<i>Welcome to my blog and my showroom of my own projects.</i>

I am a mechanical and mechatronic engineer by training and I also do software development.
I have worked on projects designing and developing electro-mechanical systems as well as mobile apps.
Right now I am studying robotics (Ecole EFREI, Master's in droides and drones, 2019-2021).
Today's technology is growing fast, and my preferred strategy is to develop solutions that empower users.
My previous projects have explored this topic: an [everyday consumer product](https://thomascarstens.github.io/tech-project/braai-tongs/), a [user-centred online platform](https://thomascarstens.github.io/tech-project/App-for-education/),
a [healthcare robot](https://thomascarstens.github.io/tech-project/Service-robot/). I write about personal projects and some tech news [on my blog](https://thomascarstens.github.io/tags/), and I am I am involved in some [tech business ventures](https://thomascarstens.github.io/business/). While I'm in Paris, I am financing my studies with work as a developer.
If you are interested in what I am doing please contact me
