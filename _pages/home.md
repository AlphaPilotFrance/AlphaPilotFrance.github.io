<i> This site is my personal blog and showroom of projects I am proud of. </i>

I am a robotic engineer and a software developer by training. I have a passion in tech entrepreneurship. I have experience in designing and developing electro-mechanical systems (UCT, Bachelors in Mechanical and Mechatronic engineering (Honours), 2015-2018) and I have developed a full-stack app (my Honours thesis). I am currently studying embedded systems and software for robotics (Ecole EFREI, Master's in droides and drones, 2019-2021). While in Paris, I am financing my studies by working as a developer. Today's technology is growing fast, and a *good* strategy is to develop solutions that empower users. My previous projects have done just that: an everyday consumer product, a user-centred online platform, a healthcare robot. I blog about my projects, I attempt to blog about the latest technology news, and I share my thoughts on technological entrepreneurship. If you are interested in what I am doing please contact me
