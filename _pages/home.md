<h2>Welcome</h2>

<br>This is my blog and my project showroom.</br>

<br>
I am a robotics engineer by training and I do tech freelancing. I develop solutions that are useful to end-users.
My previous projects have explored this topic: an everyday consumer product for the market, a user-centred online platform for university,
a service robot in healthcare. Otherwise, I write about my take on tech news, personal projects and business ventures. Browse for more!
I am currently freelancing in Paris while studying my master's in droides and drones.
If you are interested in what I am doing, contact me
