I am a developer, passionate about democratized technology, i.e. I enjoy technology-based initiatives that support user goals in a sustainable manner. Today's technology is growing fast, and various fields are finding ways to empower users, e.g. consumer products, online platforms, instant services. This focus on the user spans fields as wide as the Internet of Things or the latest killer app. I love to ask: ‘how do I conceive a technological solution that meets a certain need?’. I have experience in designing and developing electro-mechanical products, robotic software, as well as frontend and backend app development (see my skills and experience). As so, I see myself as an initiative-taker and a technological entrepreneur, with projects like my Accounts App and my University Course App (see more), and even more projects in the pipeline (see more).

<i> I am currently on the lookout to work alongside my studies over the next 2 years. How can I contribute? Press here to contact me!</i>

This site is my personal blog and showroom of projects I am proud of.
