This site is my personal blog and showroom of projects I am proud of.

I am a developer and a tech entrepreneur. I have experience in designing and developing electro-mechanical products (UCT, 2015-2018), robotic software (EFREI, 2019-2021), as well as frontend and backend app development (see more skills and experience).

I am on the lookout to contribute to technology-based initiatives. Today's technology is growing fast, and various fields are finding ways to empower users, e.g. consumer products, online platforms, instant services.  I like the idea of democratizing technology, and this motivated me to develop projects like the University Course App and the Service Robot. Currently I’m involved in other projects.

<i> I am studying in Paris between September 2019 and June 2021, in Ecole EFREI’s M1/M2 “Droides and Drones”. If you have work for me, I have a few questions for you! </i>
