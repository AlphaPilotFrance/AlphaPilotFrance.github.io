<h2>Welcome.</h2>

<br>This is my blog and display of projects.</br>

<br>
My previous projects have sought to develop solutions that are useful to end-users: everyday consumer products, online platforms, service robots. I tweet about tech news, I blog about my projects and I am seeking funding for my business ventures. Browse for more and feel free to contact me.

I am currently studying a master's in drones.
