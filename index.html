<h2>Welcome.</h2>

<br>This is my blog and display of projects.</br>

<br>
I did a double degree in mechanical and mechatronic engineering and I am self-taught in mobile app development. I am currently studying embedded intelligence in Paris (doing a master's in drones).

The projects on display all have the end-user in mind: whether it be two kitchen appliances, a mobie app for education or two service robots. I tweet about tech news, I blog about my projects and I am seeking funding for my business ventures. Browse for more and feel free to contact me.
