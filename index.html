<h2>Hello neighbor and welcome to my turf</h2>
I'm a geoscientist by training and also passionate about Python and Machine Learning. 
I study and teach vegetation dynamics, soil-vegetation-climate interactions, and 
data analytics. In addition, I build environmental models and work extensively with
geodata and satellite images. I also explore Machine Learning and Deep Learning
developments and built sophisticated data processing solutions. 
On this page I write about projects and interesting stuff I come across.
If you are interested in what I'm doing feel free to contact me.
