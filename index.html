<h2>Welcome to my blog and project showroom.</h2>


<br>
I am a Mechanical and Mechatronics engineer by training and I also do software development.
I have worked on projects designing and developing electro-mechanical systems as well as mobile apps.
Right now I am studying robotics (Ecole EFREI, Master's in droides and drones, 2019-2021).
I like taking projects from an idea to a product that is used sustainably. Today's technology is growing fast, and my preferred strategy is to develop solutions that users find useful.
My previous projects have explored this topic: an everyday consumer product, a user-centred online platform,
a healthcare robot. I write about personal projects and some tech news on my blog, and I am I am involved in some tech business ventures you'll find above. I'm currently in Paris and I am financing my studies with work as a developer.
If you are interested in what I am doing, feel free to contact me.
