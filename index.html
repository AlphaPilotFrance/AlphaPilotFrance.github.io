<h3>Hello neighbor and welcome to my turf.</h3> 
I'm a geoscientist and data nerd by training and also passionate about python and machine learning. 
I study and teach vegetation dynamics, soil-vegetation-climate interactions, and 
data analytics. In addition, I build environmental models and work extensively with
geodata and satellite images. I also explore machine learning and deep learning
developments and built sophisticated data processing solutions. On this page I write about
projects and other interesting stuff I work on or come across.

If you are interested in what I'm doing feel free to contact me.
