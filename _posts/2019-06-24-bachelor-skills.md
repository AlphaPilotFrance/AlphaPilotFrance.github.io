# ![drawing](/assets/images/favicon.jpg){: .aligned-left} Self-marketing as an engineer
## Disclaimer: This post is based on my experience and in no way should be taken as fact.

Read this if you studied UCT's Bsc Eng Mechanical and Mechatronics and you're finding it difficult to market yourself. In this post I want to **present self-marketing strategies** that I have adopted in the last year.

## Some background

So I work in tech development. I basically do it because I like making stuff, or selling it, or finding stuff to make and sell. I did a degree in Mechanical and Mechatronic engineering. This definitely did not train me as a developer (even less as a tech entrepreneur), and I soon realised that it would be useful to find ways to promote myself (e.g. this website). It's quite important for a freelancer, after all.

It's difficult, because many factors were at play in the ever-changing world of tech. Is it like that for you too? I wrote a blogpost about how I chose my career direction. The post you're reading now focuses on ways I chose to market myself as an engineer.

Everyone has a CV. Here are some ideas for things that can go in it after Bsc Eng(MMT).

# A. Focusing on skills
I have found that employers are interested in my skills, and put a focus especially on the technical skills when applying for technical roles. What skills do I have? A good question is: What value can my skills contribute to the company?

I took the skill approach because I didn't have much experience in the fields I was applying to.

## 1. Subjects on my transcript
First I looked at what skills my degree offered me.

Each subject teaches a host of areas of applications. It's difficult to pin down what skills each subject translates to. I found ways around it.

## 2. Projects in my portfolio
Laying out the technical aspects of projects is a great way of displaying the level of my different skills. Ideally, employers will click on what interests them. Click on my Portfolio tab above to get an idea of how I went about it.

How to get a portfolio up and going? There are many paid plans, but I luckily stumbled on a way to host this site for free on Github-Pages using Jekyll-now. Be warned: no CMS, no databasing, just surface-level stuff.

## 3. Listing skills during an interview

Interviewers will expect from you to list your strongpoints.

There are actually various ways of viewing the combination of your skills: I-shaped skills, T-shaped or X-shaped skills. [This article explains it better than I could.](https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-get-hired-understand-if-youre-an-i-t-or-x-s/)
I see myself as T-shaped: one area of specialty, other skills, with a collaborative mindset. Check out my CV tab above to see how I went about it. I would put it all under three broad categories.

### Technical skills
I broadly categorise my own skills as hardware and software, mechanical and mechatronic, front-end and back-end, etc. These categories make it easier to discuss them.

### Technical writing
I wrote a paper for my senior research project attesting to this skill.

### Team communication
These skills depend on the challenges that occur in team situations.

# B. Focusing on experience
Other than skills, there's a different approach to self-marketing: personal experience.

## 1. Projects in my portfolio
### Experience in similar areas
Showcasing projects in areas of interest is useful. For instance, a project in app development actually helped leverage me into robotic engineering.


### Decision-making experience
A way to show good decision-making within a project is to write about the project's constraints, limitations, success areas, and offer recommendations. Click on my Portfolio tab above to get an idea of how I went about it.

## 2. Listing jobs that were done
Associating myself with certain companies/commissions/work environments definitely adds to my profile. Check out my CV tab above to see how I went about it.

## 3. Business ventures
Business-type projects attest to the ways I take initiatives. Check out my Ventures tab above to better understand my approach.

# C. Staying current
Showcasing knowledge of the latest changes in the market, in tech, in books of a wide range of topics indicates that I am highly adaptable.

## 1. Writing about current tech news
In my field of development, staying informed of the ever-changing tech market is critical - writing about it is a work of self-promotion. I wrote a bit about this in the Opinion section of my blog.

## 2. Testing the latest technologies
I believe that the most power tool for a developer is the ability to mix and match technologies. Once you've done and tested a technology, your ability to understand further implications of the application of the tech are beyond words. I have a section in my blog called Lifestyle devoted to sharing my personal projects of new tech.

# D. Personal branding
By this I mean finding a way to sell yourself effectively to employers, even in the time when you're not actively promoting yourself.

## 1. A personal website
My website unifies all the parts mentioned above. This helps to simplify management of my professional profile.

## 2. My business card
My business card helps me stay in touch with people that I meet only once. I pull out my wallet and handover a card with my website url. That directs them here (hello!).
