# Braai tongs mechanical design

The braai is the traditional South African open-air barbecue. These braai tongs were designed to be ergonomic and durable - but also very fancy ones, with LED illumination and detachable extensions for cleaning and storing.

Mechanical design and rendering takes place throughout the Mechanical Engineering degree. This consumer product however is not only mechanically designed, but also for elegance and practicality.

Time-bound: 1 month design in a group of 3.

### Features

The tongs can attach and detach with a click. This helps with cleaning the tongs.

The electrical wiring was a little tough. We had after all chosen to power the LEDs on two sides with a single battery. But can this work with a spring-loaded contraption? This means the wiring for the other tong should be designed very carefully.

## Summary
These braai tongs were designed to be ergonomic and durable - but also very fancy ones, with LED illumination and detachable extensions for cleaning and storing.
