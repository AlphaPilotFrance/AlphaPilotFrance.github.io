# ![favicon](/assets/images/favicon.jpg){: .aligned-left} Braai tongs mechanical design

The braai is the traditional South African open-air barbecue (I'm proudly South African!). These braai tongs were designed to have LED illumination but also compete with tongs currently on the market.

Mechanical design and rendering takes place throughout the UCT's Mechanical Engineering degree. This project consisted of redesigning illuminated braaitongs to be market-competitive, but also for elegance and practicality.

Time-bound: 1 month design in a group of 3.

## Features
### Detachable tongs

### 4 LEDS per tong
The electrical wiring was a little tough. We had after all chosen to power the LEDs on two sides with a single battery. But can this work with a spring-loaded contraption? This means the wiring for the other tong should be designed very carefully.

## Summary
These braai tongs were designed to be ergonomic and durable - but also very fancy ones, with LED illumination and detachable extensions for cleaning and storing.
