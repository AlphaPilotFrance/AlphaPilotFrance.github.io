Happy New Year everybody.

I started this year off with a paper presentation for the [TWiML&AI EMEA Meetup](https://twimlai.com/meetup/) titled "Deep Learning for Remote Sensing Applications". A brief intro to optical and radar-based remote sensing and a deep learning application for generating optimal images based on radar and previous time-step images by He and Yokoya (2018). It's a nice application illustrating the use of CNN and cGAN and data fusion based on auxiliary radar images to generate optical images that might be compromised by clouds or missing-data.
