# ![drawing](/assets/images/favicon.jpg){: .aligned-left} My choice of master's
## Disclaimer: This post is based on my experience and in no way should be taken as fact.

Read this if you see yourself as a developer, but uncertain about choosing a career direction. In this post I want to **outline my motivations** for the master's I ended up going for - a masters in "Droids and Drones" at Ecole EFREI, Paris. [Here's a link to their programme outline](https://eng.efrei.fr/graduate-programs/droids-and-drones/).

## Some background

So I work in tech development. I basically do it because I like making stuff, or selling it, or finding stuff to make and sell. I did a degree in Mechanical and Mechatronic engineering. But now I want to study a master's degree (or graduate degree in the states). My main reason for studying further than my Bsc. Eng is to skill-up in a specific area of tech. There are other ways to skill up, sure. However, if I don't skill up, my options at this stage seem to be limited to technician-level engineering jobs.  I really didn't realise while I was studying that these would be my options. I have done internships in engineering spaces but I really didn't see myself spending the next, say, 10 years as an mechanical/mechatronics engineer. Skilling up during a master's could help me transition to a different area of tech. Chatting to previous graduates of my own degree made me realise that career transitions are more frequent than it appears.

I was unsure about my own skillset / what value I could contribute to the ‘world of work’. Is it like that for you too? I wrote a blogpost about ways to market yourself if you studied UCT's Bsc Eng Mechanical and Mechatronics: [link here](https://thomascarstens.github.io/opinion/bachelor-skills/). The post you're reading now focuses on my motivations for the master's I ended up going for.

## Initial motivations

I spent the last 6 months applying to various places. My approach was that of a part-time job: plan it all out, and work on it every day. I started out with the following motivations.

- I do not want to work in normal engineering jobs.
-	I want to guarantee financial stability in 10 years from now (as a general timeframe).
- I'd rather avoid having to specialise.
-	I am confused about the current state of technology in the world.
-	I'm even more confused about the future state of technology.

## List of masters' applications
Before I explain more detailed motivations: Here is a summary of my masters’ applications, in order of application.
1. MIT Media Lab | **Media innovation** at the Responsive Environments Lab or the Fluid Interfaces Lab, 2y | rejected
2. Paris Saclay Fablab | **digital fabrication**, 8months | aborted (no scholarship)
3. Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC), Barcelona | **Robotics for construction**, 1y | accepted but aborted (expensive, competed unsuccessfully for scholarship, too specialised)
4. KTH, Stockholm| **Autonomous Systems**, 2y | aborted (uploaded files accidentally corrupted)
5. Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden| **Interaction Design**, 2y | aborted (uploaded files accidentally corrupted)
5. EIT Digital, Madrid+Paris | **HCID**, 2y | accepted with scholarship, aborted (reservations about HCID)
6. Ecole EFREI, Paris | **Embedded systems** for Droides & Drones, 2y | accepted, going.
7. EMARO+, Nantes+Zurich | **Advanced Robotics**, 2y | aborted (reference letter uploaded too late)
8. Emerson College, Boston | **Civic Media Design**, 1y | accepted with scholarship, aborted (too expensive)
9. Ecole Polytechnique Paris | **Product development** and **business management** as ‘Internet of Things, Innovation and Management’, 2y | accepted with 0% interest loan, aborted (reservations about curriculum)
10. EURECOM, Sofia-Antipolis | **telecommunications** as ‘Internet of Things’, 2y | rejected.


# Detailed motivations
I decided I would do a Masters in a specific field as a way to develop a strong suit for employers (employers commonly refer to this as "T-shaped skills", [see article](https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-get-hired-understand-if-youre-an-i-t-or-x-s/) ). Points that appealed to me for various Masters were:
-	A 2 year programme | What can I realistically achieve in a year that can position me in the right place?
-	Scholarship/bursary preferably | There are financial constraints
-	Europe | For the experience of living independently overseas
-	Paris | I have a French passport and family residing in Paris (very fortunate)
-	Program with industrial exposure | It shows that the program caters to the needs of companies, and so the program has the most current technologies and high employability.

That been said, I obviously had certain paths in mind based on my own experience.

## 1. Landing in Boston, USA
My goal is to ultimately study a Masters in Boston. The MIT Media Lab has caught my attention as a hub of technological development with a major human focus. Just landing in Boston is a move I really would like to make. As a result, I applied to MIT (in **media innovation**) and Emerson College (in **civic media design**). I was rejected from MIT (not really surprised) and Emerson College offered me a place, but when getting down to the costs, I realised it was too bold a career move.

## 2. Studying as soon as possible
I really wanted to study something for free as soon as I could. As a result, I applied to Paris Saclay (in **digital fabrication**). Yet I did not receive a scholarship, so, no cigar.

## 3. Skilling up in platform design
My senior research project was in **app development**. I developed and implemented a custom mobile app at the University of Cape Town. I liked how much potential there is for impact in the daily life of people, i.e. to create a product that has direct implementational value and is scalable. As a result, I applied to Malmö University (in **interaction design**) and EIT Digital (in **human-computer interfaces**). For Malmö, I didn’t send my transcript in the right format and I was therefore ineligible. As for EIT Digital, I was accepted around the same time as other programmes and it caused me to think hard about platform design. I realised that it may be fun and somehow lucrative, but I was aware that it was not a very stable field to work in. After all, **app development** will not be booming in 5 years as it is now (according to software developers at my local tech hub, Codebridge). Students at EIT describe their internships as marred by difficulties to convince the company of the worth of conducting market research. That did not appeal to me.

## 4. Skilling up in robotics
My degree in **mechanical and mechatronic engineering** has placed me in a very priviledged position. The previous options are in many ways a transition from my studies. However, some options can further me as a technical engineer such as **autonomous systems** and **robotics**. As a result, I applied to IAAC (in **robotics for construction**), KTH (in **autonomous systems**) and EMARO+ (in **advanced robotics**). I was accepted in the first, but I accidentally messed up my application files for the next two (what a waste of time…). Careful consideration of the field of **robotics for construction** made me realise that it is in its nascent stages. There is actually very little guarantee of it being a stable field in a few years. According to reports by BCG and Bain, there is a major push to bring **robotics** on the construction site (**land-surveying** drones, **land-forming** robots) but the actual needs of construction companies have not been spelled out yet. This did not appeal to me.

## 5. Doing tech entrepreneurship
I have a passion for tech entrepreneurship. I decided that engineering programmes with a **management** component are particularly interesting. As a result, I applied to Polytechnique Paris (in **product development** and **business management**). I actually got in, and I was proud due to the school’s prestige in the local region. I however thought I should consult students of the programme because, you know, tuition alone costs 24000€. I managed to speak to current students. I realised that this programme trains students to be experts in a very specific **telecommunications technology** (Bluetooth, Wifi) and using this training, the second year then supports the students in developing their own **business/consulting** for a corporate. This is bold. It’s a huge risk. What if my business doesn’t make it 5 years from now? Two reports by Cisco (USA, mid-2018) and BCG (international, mid-2018, [see here](https://www.bcg.com/en-za/industries/technology-industries/making-jump-to-internet-of-things.aspx) ) list severe limitations for the **Internet of Things** to gain traction within business, but will it happen in the next 5 years? Or will my business struggle to get started? And in 5 years I will also be required to pay back the 24000€. Will I be able to rely on the network of alumni like Polytechnique proclaims? I know that a Master’s is in itself a bold move; but odds these high are a bit too uncertain for me.

## 6. Skilling up in software development
Following conversations with CEOS of **product and software development** companies, I realised that it would be very strategic to gain skills in **system development**. My approach, basically, is to gain even more experience as a developer, while learning the technologies involved in two of the most promising fields coming up in the next few years: in **robotics** and in **cloud computing**. As a result, I applied to EURECOM (in **telecommunications**) and Ecole EFREI (in **embedded systems**). I was cleanly rejected from the first. But I was accepted in to the second. So, all in all, what does EFREI offer me? I like it a lot. Here is the final summary.

# Summary
Ecole EFREI seems like the most strategic direction for me, because I did decide I would do a Masters in a specific field as a way to develop a strong suit for employers (upskilling). In other words:
-	To establish myself as a capable robotics engineer via my projects and the French professional license offered by the school.
-	To search for work that can help finance my studies, and internships that can give me experience in the vast field of **robotics**.
-	To become much more familiar with the tech market over the next 2 years than I am now.

In terms of time and money:
- It’s a 2 year-programme (what I am looking for).
- There is a bursary covering me for the next 5 years, and fortunately if I work as a robotic engineer I can pay them back under 2 years.
- The program definitely has industrial exposure, with two 3-5month internships, and the school’s [local ranking](https://www.efrei.fr/ecole-ingenieur/classements/) is fascinating. Thus the program has the most current technologies and high employability.
- Aside from all this… Living in a different culture (Paris rather than Cape Town) is going to teach me a huge lot. I’m going to love it. I can’t wait to reconnect with French family.

There are many sites that are in the process of cataloguing all the scholarships that are out there. I used a combination of ScholarshipPortal and Scholars4Dev.
