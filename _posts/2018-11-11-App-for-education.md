# App for an Engineering Undergraduate Course

Supervised by Bruce Kloot of Mechanical Engineering UCT, I designed and developed a mobile application for enhanced interaction in engineering learning and I implemented within two undergraduate courses.

The goal of this project was to design an online learning space as an effective means for students to interact with tutors in the Dynamics 1 course. It was envisioned that through this process, the students are better included and empowered in their own learning process. The final product was an application called Dynamics App. Using the app, students can now post a question in a feed for tutors to be notified immediately. The app is currently on the Google Playstore, Testflight on the iStore (contact me for the invite link) as well as a webapp. Such a tool did not exist in the UCT Mechanical Engineering Department, and it is well suited to a course that requires of students to grasp and apply various kinetic and kinematic concepts in a short amount of time. I am looking to expand it in various other courses.

Time-bound: 4 months development.

I made a video where I show the different features on the app.

## Project Plan
The starting question here is: “Does the students’ use of the online space enhance their experience of the course?”. This question requires the existence of such a space, and a means to measure whether the online space has enhanced the students’ experience of the course. For the first part, the online space must be conceived, developed and implemented within the course; for the second part, an indicator is chosen to measure the success of this space.
This project was planned in a sequence of phases:

%}  

### Phase 1: Literature Review                                                        
Reviewing similar literature to select the most adequate indicator of success.

### Phase 2: Conceptualisation   
Researching the current means of learning so to select the most adapted concept for an online space.

### Phase 3: Development   
Developing this concept into an online space that can be implemented in the course.

### Phase 4: Implementation   
Promoting the online space among students as a tool for learning.

### Phase 5: Iterations   
Iteratively developing the online space according to recommendations and maintenance issues.

## Summary
I made a poster summarising the project.
